# Project Standards & Conventions

This file contains universal project standards and conventions that apply across all projects. For project-specific details (technology stack, frameworks, tools), **always read the project's README.md file first**.

## Reading Project Documentation

**CRITICAL:** Before starting any work, you MUST:
1. Read the project's `README.md` file to understand:
   - Technology stack and frameworks used
   - Project structure and organization
   - Development setup and requirements
   - Project-specific conventions and preferences
   - Any special instructions or notes

2. Read the project's `.todo.md` file to understand:
   - What has been worked on previously
   - Current task context and history
   - Completed and in-progress work
   - Any ongoing plans or decisions

3. Read the project's `learnings.md` file (if it exists) to understand:
   - Learned workflows and preferences
   - Documented standard practices
   - Project-specific rules and conventions
   - Any processes that have been saved

4. Check for additional documentation in `/docs` folder if needed

5. Follow the project's established patterns and conventions

## Documentation Location

**CRITICAL:** All documentation files MUST be created in the `/docs` folder. The only exception is `README.md` which should be in the project root.

- All guides, tutorials, and how-to docs → `/docs`
- All API documentation files → `/docs`
- All architecture and design docs → `/docs`
- All process and workflow docs → `/docs`
- Project README → root `/README.md` (exception)

When creating documentation, always use the path `/docs/[filename].md` (or appropriate subdirectory if organizing by category).

## Universal Conventions

### Git Workflow
- Use conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`)
- Create feature branches for all changes
- Never commit directly to `main`, `dev`, `master`, or `production` branches
- Write atomic commits (one logical change per commit)

### Task Management
- Use `.todo.md` for all task planning
- Append to `.todo.md` (keep history)
- Include role assignments in task lists
- Update checklist as tasks complete

### Documentation Standards
- Always include current date in documentation
- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples and code snippets when helpful
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

## Best Practices

1. **Always Plan First**: Use the workflow process (create `.todo.md`, plan, get approval)
2. **Read the README**: Always check `README.md` for project-specific information
3. **Use Personas**: Leverage the expert team for appropriate tasks
4. **Document Decisions**: Record architectural and design decisions in `/docs`
5. **Keep It Simple**: Avoid over-engineering; start simple, iterate
6. **Security First**: Consider security implications in all code
7. **Test Critical Paths**: Focus testing on what matters most
8. **Maintain Clean History**: Use proper git workflow and commit messages

## When Creating New Features

Follow this standard workflow:
1. Read `README.md` to understand project context
2. Read `.todo.md` to understand what has been worked on and current context
3. Read `learnings.md` (if exists) to understand learned rules and preferences
4. Product Manager → Define user stories and acceptance criteria
5. Software Architect → Design system architecture
6. Developer → Implement the feature (using project's tech stack from README)
7. Code Reviewer → Review code quality
8. QA Engineer → Write tests
9. Security Analyst → Security review
10. UI/UX Designer → UX review (if applicable)
11. Technical Writer → Document in `/docs`

## Notes for AI Agents

- **Always read `README.md` first** for project-specific technology stack, frameworks, and conventions
- **Always read `.todo.md`** to understand what has been worked on, current context, and work history
- **Always read `learnings.md`** (if it exists) to understand learned rules, workflows, and preferences
- When creating files, follow the project structure (check README for details)
- When writing code, follow the project's established patterns and conventions
- When creating documentation, always place it in `/docs` (except root README.md)
- When unsure about project specifics, refer to README.md, `.todo.md`, or `learnings.md` or ask clarifying questions
